This directory contains all the codes that test for best fits, as well as images that were added to the thesis. There are a lot of similar Jupyter notebooks because I was testing out for each spectrum's epoch the inclusion/combination of a spiral arm, disk winds, and/or an outflow component. The following list tells how to access the notebooks containing data that were eventually included in the paper (I didn't want to change anything to prevent path-finding errors in the codes).

AT2018dyb (also known as ASASSN-18pg)
ASASSN-18pg/New
(Epoch-9.6 means the spectrum from the epoch that was recorded 9.6 days before peak visible light, and so on for the other epochs)

AT2018hyz
Inside the AT2018hyz folder, the actual chronological order is second-epoch (36d), first-epoch (63d), third-epoch (119d). Any notebooks outside these folders are from a long time ago.

AT2019qiz
AT2019qiz/Epochs

AT2020nov was unused since the only spectrum that I found on https://www.wiserep.org/ had a very low resolution. But Charlotte said this is an interesting object according to its source papers, so maybe ask the authors for more spectra!

AT2020zso
The notebook called H-alpha-fit-spiral-arm.ipynb
