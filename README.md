This repo is a fork of Charlotte's codes from the above link. Some large files were removed using automation, mostly the .h5 files from emcee, so if there are any missing/incompatible essential files here, please refer back to the Charlotte's repo (sorry for my inexperience with GitHub!).

The three folders I created for my thesis are `codes`, `old-codes`, and `spectra`:
* In `codes`, I stored all the codes for each TDE's spectrum as well as the images that made it into the paper. There are text files in there for more information.
* In `old-codes`, I had my experimental codes from the very start of the project (basically the warm-ups). However, I've also stored some emcee codes there at one point (in `Codes-Emcee`), though the .h5 files were deleted.
* In `spectra`, I put text files that contain the spectra for the four TDEs. These files were also the starting point of the project in `codes`, so I didn't dare to delete it.

If you have any questions, please reach out to Charlotte or me (at4206@alumni.princeton.edu). The email for this GitHub account will be deleted soon, so there won't be future changes. Thanks for checking out!
